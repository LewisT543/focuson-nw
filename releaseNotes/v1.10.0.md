# Release 1.10.0

## Conditions

We now support conditional logic such as 'and', 'or' and 'not'. And have a lot more conditions. If you need a condition
that isn't here: ask

* The order of being added to guards matters (if you refer to it, you need to be after it)

```typescript
guards: {
  canPrint: { condition: 'equals', value: false, path: '~/display[~/selected]/alreadyPrinted' },
  hasStandingOrders: { condition: '>0', path: '~/display[~/selected]/listOfPayments/standingOrders/numberOfItems' },
  hasOpenBankingStandingOrders: { condition: '>0', path: '~/display[~/selected]/listOfPayments/openBankingStandingOrders/numberOfItems' },
  hasDirectDebits: { condition: '>0', path: '~/display[~/selected]/listOfPayments/directDebits/numberOfItems' },
  hasBillPayments: { condition: '>0', path: '~/display[~/selected]/listOfPayments/billPayments/numberOfItems' },
  hasOpenBanking: { condition: '>0', path: '~/display[~/selected]/listOfPayments/openBanking/numberOfItems' },
  hasSomethingToPrint: { condition: 'or', conditions: [ 'hasStandingOrders', 'hasOpenBankingStandingOrders', 'hasDirectDebits', 'hasBillPayments', 'hasOpenBanking' ] },
  authorisedByUser: { condition: 'equals', value: '"y"', path: '~/display[~/selected]/authorisedByCustomer' },
  sendingToUser: { condition: 'contains', values: [ 'M', 'J' ], path: '~/display[~/selected]/requestedBy' },
  canClickPrint: { condition: 'or', conditions: [ 'sendingToUser', 'authorisedByUser' ] }
},
```

## deprecated Audit and added Mutations

We can

```typescript
export const chequeCreditBooksRestD: RestD<AllGuards> = {
  params: commonIds,
  dataDD: ChequeCreditbooksDD,
  url: '/api/chequeCreditBooks?{query}', //or maybe accountId={accountId}&customerId={customerId}
  actions: [ 'get', 'create', { "state": 'cancel' }, { "state": 'revalidate' } ],

  states: {
    cancel: { url: '/api/chequeCreditBooks/cancel?{query}', params: [ 'clientRef', 'accountId' ] },
    revalidate: { url: '/api/chequeCreditBooks/revalidate?{query}', params: [ 'clientRef', 'accountId' ] }
  },
  mutations: [
    {
      restAction: 'create', mutateBy: [
        {
          mutation: 'storedProc', name: 'sequencename', params: [
            { type: 'output', name: 'checkbookId', javaType: 'Integer', sqlType: 'INTEGER' },
            { type: 'output', name: 'checkbookIdPart2', javaType: 'String', sqlType: 'CHAR' },
          ], schema: onlySchema
        },
        // { mutation: 'IDFromSequence', name: 'sequencename', params: { type: 'output', name: 'checkbookId' }, schema: onlySchema },
        {
          mutation: 'storedProc',
          name: 'auditCreateCheckBook',
          params: [ 'brandRef', {type: 'input', 'accountId'}, 'checkbookId', 'checkbookIdPart2' ],
          schema: onlySchema
        } ]
    },
    {
      restAction: 'get',
      mutateBy: {
        mutation: 'storedProc',
        name: 'auditGetCheckBook',
        params: [ 'brandRef', 'accountId' ],
        schema: onlySchema
      }
    },
    {
      restAction: { state: 'cancel' },
      mutateBy: {
        mutation: 'storedProc',
        name: 'auditCancelCheckbook',
        params: [ 'brandRef', 'accountId' ],
        schema: onlySchema
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

There are the following types of mutateBy:
* storedProc: call a stored procedure
* sql: use this sql to do a sideeffect
* manual: insert these lines of code
Please note that you can have a single mutate, or an array of them

There are the following types of params:
* A simple string is the same as 'param'. It means 'you have access to the parameter either from the end point, or from an earlier output param'
* 'string': some stored procedures need string literals. This is how you set them
* 'param': It means 'you have access to the parameter either from the end point, or from an earlier output param'
* 'integer': some stored procedures need integer literals. This is how you set them
* 'null': some stored procedures need null literals. This is how you set them
* 'output': this is a output param. 
  * If for manual code you need to give the name and the java type
  * If for raw sql you also need to give the 'rsName' which is the name in the resultSet
  * If for a storedProcedure you need to give the 'sqlType' which is prefixed by `java.sql.Types.` and tells jdbc what type of variable it is
  * These output params  are available for consumption in later mutations
Please note that you can have a single param or an array of them

## Date picker

The date picker now looks much nicer, and handles things like weekends and holidays. There is a demo in ETransfers

```typescript
export const LabelAndDateInputCD: DisplayCompD = {
  import: "@focuson/form_components", name: "LabelAndDateInput",
  params: {
    ...commonParamsWithLabel,
    datesExcluded: { paramType: 'path', needed: 'no' },
    workingDaysInFuture: { paramType: 'object', needed: 'no' },
    includeWeekends: { paramType: 'boolean', needed: 'no' }
  }
}

//Usage
...,
dateOfETransfer: {
  dataDD: DateDD, displayParams
:
  {
    datesExcluded: '~/holidays/', workingDaysInFuture
  :
    5, includeWeekends
  :
    true
  }
}
```

## LabelAndDropDown

Now works much nicer. It ties in the 'validation' system: so for example if nothing is selected then the commit button (
by default) will not be clickable

The 'pleaseSelect' vanishes if there is something selected

```typescript
export const LabelAndDropDownCD: DisplayCompD = {
  import: '@focuson/form_components',
  name: "LabelAndDropdown",
  params: {
    ...commonParamsWithLabel, ...enumParams,
    pleaseSelect: { paramType: 'string', needed: 'no' },
    size: { paramType: 'object', needed: 'no' },
    required: { paramType: 'boolean', needed: 'no' },
  }
}
```

## DataDrivenFixedOptionDropDownAndDetails

This supports the kind of situation where we have a main and a joint and we need to pick them (i.e. a defined list) but
we want the data in the list to be data driven, and we also want to be able to display the details of that

```typescript
export const DataDrivenFixedOptionDropDownAndDetailsCD: DisplayCompD = {
  import: "@focuson/form_components", name: "DataDrivenFixedOptionDropDownAndDetails",
  params: {
    ...commonParamsWithLabel,
    details: { paramType: "jsonWithDisplayFn", needed: 'yes' },
    parentState: { paramType: 'object', needed: 'defaultToParentState' },
    pleaseSelect: { paramType: 'string', needed: 'no' },

  }
}
```

## Insert sql strategy

We will be gradually adding more strategies. These create the sample data in the database

The first strategy is 'OneTableInsertSqlStrategyForNoIds', we will be following it with '
OneTableInsertSqlStrategyWithIds'. These are great for handling lookup data.

```typescript
export const postcodeRestD: RestD<AllGuards> = {
  params: postcodeParams,
  dataDD: postCodeSearchResponseDD,
  url: '/api/postCode?{query}',
  actions: [ 'get' ],
  initialSql: addressSearchSql,
  insertSqlStrategy: { type: 'OneTableInsertSqlStrategyForNoIds', table: postCodeSearchTable },
  tables: {
    entity: {
      type: 'Main',
      table: postCodeSearchTable
    },
    where: [
      {
        table: postCodeSearchTable,
        alias: postCodeSearchTable.name,
        field: 'PC_POSTCODE',
        paramName: 'postcode',
        comparator: 'like',
        paramPrefix: '%',
        paramPostfix: '%'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Minor

* Modal pages now have labels
* Restructured the names of many many things
* Commit/cancel buttons now have text
* There is a new debug options 'guard debug'. This makes the guards print messages in the console.log. This is useful if
  you have issues with guards

## What do you need to do to use the upgrade

* Change the version number in your package.json
* kill all generated source code (this is really important this time)
* npm install as usual (both in the generator and the formts)
* Optionally update the 'initial debug' in 'focus.config.ts' (add `guardDebug: true`)  - improves display of debug button
* You DO NOT need to delete node_modules.
* If you have made use of audit in your restDs these will no longer work
  * You will get warnings when you generate code. In a few weeks, these will become errors.

## Migration guide

Please note that this is not obligatory this release. It will become obligatory in the future. However the audits
nolonger actually work.

```typescript
audit:[ {
  restAction: 'create',
  storedProcedure: { name: 'auditCreate', schema: onlySchema, params: [ 'accountId' ] }
} ],
```

To this

```typescript
mutations: [
  {
    restAction: 'create',
    mutateBy: { mutation: 'storedProc', name: 'auditCreate', params: [ 'accountId' ], schema: onlySchema }
  } ]
```
