# Datepicker
I hoped to have the datepicker resolved, but a number of factors prevented it
* A lot more requests for new features than expected
* The loss of team members
* Personal issues

The outstanding issue is 'how do we get the reference data' and that is well underway: it just needs the polish to be releasable. 

# Commands in general

# Fetcher commands
When we have fetched data using a fetcher we might want to 'do something else'. One example we need for
optimistic locking is to copy the data to a 'original data place'. Other examples might be a message, or to copy just 
a part of the data

```typescript
 rest: {
    authorisedCharges: {
      rest: AuthorisedChargesRD, targetFromPath: '~/authorisedCharges/fromApi/editingData', fetcher: true,
      postFetchCommands: [
        { command: 'message', msg: 'loading the authorised charges' },
        { command: 'copyResult', from: '', to: '~/authorisedCharges/fromApi/originalData' }
      ]
    }
}
    
```

# Message Commands can now have data in them
When we have a message, we can include data 

# Support for multiple teams in the final application

## There is a team property in the appConfig

## The redux code is now team specific

# Boolean patterns for yes/no

# new comparator for same day for dates



```typescript
  initialValue: {
    authorisedCharges: { date: '2020/01/01' }
  },
```

to  
initialValue: { command: 'set', path: '~/authorisedCharges/date', value: '2020/01/01' },

Example of usage
```typescript
initialValue: [ { command: 'copy', from: '/CommonIds/today', to: '~/authorisedCharges/date' } ],
```

# Initial value can take {command: 'deletePageTags'}
If needed we'll add it to other commands. It's very brutal...

# Handling funny date issues in oracle. 1/3/2013 should work.



```java
      statement.setString(1,DateFormatter.stringToDateString("dd/MM/yyyy",date));

```

# Sql on multiple lines


# Wizard support
```typescript
    next: { control: 'ModalButton', modal: wizard4, mode: 'view', focusOn: '~/nothing' , pageOp: 'replace'},
```
