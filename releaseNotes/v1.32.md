 1# Fetcher commands

# Boolean patterns for yes/no

# new comparator for same day for dates



```typescript
  initialValue: {
    authorisedCharges: { date: '2020/01/01' }
  },
```

to  
initialValue: { command: 'set', path: '~/authorisedCharges/date', value: '2020/01/01' },

Example of usage
```typescript
initialValue: [ { command: 'copy', from: '/CommonIds/today', to: '~/authorisedCharges/date' } ],
```

# Initial value can take {command: 'deletePageTags'}
If needed we'll add it to other commands. It's very brutal...

# Handling funny date issues in oracle. 1/3/2013 should work.



```java
      statement.setString(1,DateFormatter.stringToDateString("dd/MM/yyyy",date));

```

# Sql on multiple lines


# Wizard support
```typescript
    next: { control: 'ModalButton', modal: wizard4, mode: 'view', focusOn: '~/nothing' , pageOp: 'replace'},
```
