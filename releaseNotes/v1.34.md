Note that this is just display: no changing of the text. We can have the {} notation, and we can have html in the code
```typescript
    displayStringWithLookup: {
      dataDD: { ...StringDD, display: DisplayStringWithLookupCD, emptyValue: 'A' },
      displayParams: { lookup: { A: 'The value was A', B: 'The value was B' } }
    },
```

# LayoutCD

title/rightHandTitle and optional classes for them

export const LayoutCd: DisplayCompD = {
  params: {
    ...
    details: { paramType: 'string', needed: 'yes' },
    title: { paramType: 'string', needed: 'no' },
    titleClassName: { paramType: 'string', needed: 'no' },
    rightHandTitle: { paramType: 'string', needed: 'no' },
    rightHandClassName: { paramType: 'string', needed: 'no' },
  },
}
```
