# Parameter types
These are the parameters in resolvers or mutations. Typically used to interact with sql or stored procedures.

## fromParent
When we have resolvers that aren't the 'main resolver', then they return their value after the resolvers that 'contain' them
have done their work. This allows us to do 'calculations' such as 'the full name is the title + a space + first name + a space + last name'.

Currently `fromParent` only works on 'immediate siblings'. That might change if we have a need, and then it will become a path

```typescript
resolvers: {

    getFullName: {
      type: 'manual',
      params: [
        { type: 'fromParent', name: 'title', javaType: 'String' },
        { type: 'fromParent', name: 'forename', javaType: 'String' },
        { type: 'fromParent', name: 'surname', javaType: 'String' },
        { type: 'output', name: 'fullname', javaType: 'String' },
      ],
      code: `String fullname = title + " " + forename + " " + surname;`,
    },
  },
```

## body
When working with inserts and updates, we have a lot of data in the 'body' of the request. We want to be able to access that data
as values for stored procedures/sql queries or just generally. These work with datePattern as you would expect

```typescript
   {
          type: 'sql', name: 'getSql', sql: 'update createPlan set v1=?,v2=?,v3=? where seqName=?', params: [
            { type: 'body', path: 'a.b.c.v1InJson', javaType: 'String' },
            { type: 'body', path: 'v2InJson', javaType: 'String', datePattern: 'dd/MM/yyyy' },
            { type: 'body', path: 'v3InJson', javaType: 'String' },
            'accountId'
          ], schema: onlySchema
        },
```

# New mutation: message
This can be placed as a mutation or resolver.  
```typescript
    { type: "message", message: 'It worked!!!' }
```


# state changes - fromBody
The current 'model' for 'rest' is that the restful operations 'know' about a place in the state, and all operations
take information from there, or put it there. That works most of the time. But we have a need to basically do a 'get', and 
a load of information is needed in the get. Effectively the 'get' wants a json block as parameters.

It's not possible to send a get with a body from the common browsers (don't ask why), so we had to model this another way.
we model it as a statechange and we tell the rest 'where to get the body from'. By default it will get it from the 
'normal place' which is the 'target' in the pageD. However we can override that:

```typescript
export const ValidatePayeeRD: ExampleRestD = {
  params: {},
  dataDD: ValidatedPayeeDetailsDD,
  url: '/api/payeedetails/validate?{query}',
  actions: [ { state: 'validate' } ],
  states: {
    validate: { params: {}, url: '/api/payeedetails/validate?{query}', bodyFrom: '~/onePayment', returns: [ 'payeeStatus' ] }
  },
```

# mutations - returns
State changes previously 'returned nothing'. However we need to use them to overcome the weakness of browsers that don't support
rest and force us to do a 'get' using 'post'. So far the only need is to return one or a handful of values so we added `returns`.
The output variables listed in returns will be in the json returned. This is quite fiddly to work with, so experiment a bit if
you want to use it. 

This result from the state is NOT used normally. It doesn't replace the target. It can really only be used by modal or rest buttons
with the copy command.

```typescript
export const ValidatePayeeRD: ExampleRestD = {
  params: {},
  dataDD: ValidatedPayeeDetailsDD,
  url: '/api/payeedetails/validate?{query}',
  actions: [ { state: 'validate' } ],
  states: {
    validate: { params: {}, url: '/api/payeedetails/validate?{query}', bodyFrom: '~/onePayment', returns: [ 'payeeStatus' ] }
  },
  mutations: [
    {
      restAction: { state: 'validate' }, mutateBy: {
        type: 'manual', code: 'String payeeStatus= "SUCCEEDED!!!!!";', makeMock: false,  params: [
          { type: 'output', name: 'payeeStatus', javaType: 'String' }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# controllerAnnotations: "@CrossOrigin()" & endpoint annotations
There is a need to add annotations to every controller. This is now easy: 

We are working on adding a templating language to endpointAnnotations, so that we can 
generate 'context sensitive annotations' but that's not ready yet

````typescript
generate ( logLevel, directorySpec, devAppConfig, {
    ...params,
    controllerAnnotations: [ "@CrossOrigin()" ],
    endpointAnnotations: ['@SomeSecurityAnnotation("someText")'],
    focusOnVersion,
    thePackage: 'somepackage.somepostfix.another',
    theme: 'theme-dark'
    ,
  },
  javaOutputRoot, tsRoot, AllGuardCreator, makeButtons () ) ( generatedPages )
````
# useLeftJoin
When we are using the `tables` mechanism to get data from the backend, sometimes we have a situation like a 'main' and a 'joint' account. And while the
main account is guaranteed to exist (or it is an error) the joint may not. Long term we will be introducing a better mechanism but for now we have the 
`useLeftJoin` flag which says 'use left joins instead of wheres'. 

This feature hasn't been tested in production yet, so we'll work with the teams to check it works
```typescript
  tables: {
    entity: {
      type: 'Main',
      table: loanAppTable,
      useLeftJoin: true,
      staticWhere: `${loanAppTable.name}.ind='M'`,
      children: {
        secondayAppTable: {type: 'Single',    filterPath: 'joint',table: loanAppTable, idInParent: 'client_ref', idInThis: 'client_ref', staticWhere: `secondayAppTable.ind='j'`, children:{
            joint: {
              table: clientNames_C10T, type: 'Single', idInParent: 'client_ref', idInThis: 'cliref',
              children: {
                jointAddress: { table: clientAddress_C60T, type: 'Single', idInParent: 'cliref', idInThis: 'cliref' }
              }
            }
          }},
        main: {
          table: clientNames_C10T, type: 'Single', idInParent: 'client_ref', idInThis: 'cliref',
          filterPath: 'main',
          children: {
            mainAddress: { table: clientAddress_C60T, type: 'Single', idInParent: 'cliref', idInThis: 'cliref'}
          }
        },
      }
    },
    where: [ { table: loanAppTable, alias: loanAppTable.name, field: 'client_ref', paramName: 'clientRef' } ]
  }

```

# Validation
Currently validations such as 'min', 'required', 'pattern' etc are handled by `displayParams`. We have decided to 
move them to their own 'validation' area. This is a nicer user experience as the type system gives good code insight. In
addition it makes it easier for us to use the validations and provide server side validation.

This is 'on going work'. All the existing `displayParams` will still work: there's no need to change yet. The advantage 
of using the validations is that they are 'server side as well' (or will be)

Currently we can use them with primitives. Next week we hope to be able to use them in more places
```typescript
export const MoneyDD: NumberPrimitiveDD = {
  ...floatPrimDD,
  display: LabelAndNumberInputCD,
  sample: [ 100.23, 200.45, 300 ],
  description: "The primitive representing an amount of the local currency",
  name: 'Money',
  validate: { step: 0.01 }                                //<-------------------
}
export const PositiveMoneyDD: NumberPrimitiveDD = {
  ...MoneyDD,
  validate: { min: 0, step: 0.01 }                       //<-------------------
}

```

# Bugs:
## readonly on dropsdowns
This wasn't possible

## radiogroups
We introduced a bug last release. It's fixed

# Date picker:
The holidays didn't obey the date format

# Mutation guide
There are no known issues

## Date picker
If you set up a holidays you will need to check it still works. If it doesn't check the date patterns. 
Shout if you need help 

## States
State changes have changed quite notably. Hopefully there is no impact, but if there is let me know.
Again shout if you need help
