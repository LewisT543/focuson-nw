* alias on main entity (sql)
  Oracle 10g only has 32 characters for table and field names. If we need to 'shrink' a main name we can give it an alias
  This feature isn't fully working yet: it will be fixed on the nightly
```typescript
 tables: {
    where: [...],
    entity: {
      type: 'Main',
      table: accountT,
      alias: 'j',
```
