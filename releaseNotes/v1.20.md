* alias on main entity (sql)
  Oracle 10g only has 32 characters for table and field names. If we need to 'shrink' a main name we can give it an alias
  This feature isn't fully working yet: it will be fixed on the nightly
```typescript
 tables: {
    where: [...],
    entity: {
      type: 'Main',
      table: accountT,
      alias: 'j',
```

# Messaging
* messageType on output params
* Data format changed to support messages
* Pages have time stamps now

# Redux
* We can now use redux as the engine


# Tables
* emptyData
* tableTitle
* Structure Tables

# Rests
Rests can have multiple deletes

Multiple paths on action buttons
```typescript
 buttons: {
    approvePendingFees: { control: "ActionButton", 
            path: '#editingData',
            text: 'Approve Pending Fees', 
            action: 'approvePendingFees', 
            path2: '~/selectedDateItem/dateCreated',
            path3: '~/selectedDateItem' },
}
```
