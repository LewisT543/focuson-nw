# noDatais404
We keep finding new places to allow 'noDatais404'. This is now added in all the places we know of. 

# guard pageModeEquals
We can now have guards based on the page mode. 
```typescript
    guards: {
        pageModeView: { condition: 'pageModeEquals', mode: 'view' }
    },
```

# Delete commands accept a list of paths
This is a very minor change to stop having to have multiple delete commands. 

# Modal commit buttons can have commands
Normally we define commands at the point of opening the modal window. However we have found a couple of places where it is convenient to have these commands
defined on the modal commit as well. 

# Guarded buttons can use name of a guard condition
Previously we had to 'fully define the guard' when we had guarded buttons. At the time we wrote the code we didn't have `guard` on the pageD. 
We now accept both ways of working
```typescript
    guards: { dropdownYes: { condition: 'equals', path: 'dropdown', value: '"Y"' } },
    buttons: {
      pageGuardDirect: {
          guard: { control: 'ModalButton', modal: EnabledByModalPageD, focusOn: '~/onChange', mode: 'edit' },
          by: { condition: 'equals', path: 'dropdown', value: '"Y"' }
        },
        pageGuardName: {
          guard: { control: 'ModalButton', modal: EnabledByModalPageD, focusOn: '~/onChange', mode: 'edit' },
          by: 'dropdownYes'
        }
```

# min-height in viewport
The debug button is now much better behaved when the 'back page' is a modal popup.

# Modal buttons have commit / cancel window option
```typescript
buttons: {
    commit: {
      control: 'ModalCommitButton', 
      confirm: { type: 'window', confirmText: 'Confirm', cancelText: 'Cancel', messageText: "some message" }
    },
    cancel: { control: 'ModalCancelButton', confirm: { type: 'window' } }
```
Options in `confirm` include the following. They all have defaults  
```typescript
  pageName?: string;     //don't use this. It's used when we want to make a new confirm/cancel popup. For now leave it undefined
  title?: string;        // The title
  className?: string;    // A class name if you need to tweak the css
  messageText?: string;  // Some message
  confirmText?: string;  // the text on the confirm button
  cancelText?: string;   // the text on the cancel button
```

# LabelAndYNCheckboxInputCD & YesNoCheckboxDD
When we have a thing that is a boolean, but is represented in the database by the strings 'Y' and 'N' we can use this
```typescript
    ynCheckbox: { dataDD: YesNoCheckboxDD, displayParams: { enabledBy: 'yes' } },
```

# Versions, versions, versions
We have made many changes to the version numbers of files and are still working on this

# React 16
We downgraded the version of react we are using react 16 for compatability with other projects. We also have tried to 
make it so that our projects 'don't care' about what version of react they are actually run with. This is a little 
awkward because of the date picker and we are still trying to resolve issues around that

# placeholder
We can now have placeholder text. I think it is added on most places. If you find a place it that doesn't work, let me know
```typescript
    someName: { dataDD: StringDD, displayParams: {  placeholder: 'String goes here...' } },

```
# Accounts ids
are 6 to 10 digits now
```typescript
    accountId: { dataDD: AccountIdDD, displayParams: { label: "Account Id" } },
```

# loadingCursorFetch
We now change the cursor when loading. This needs the project to configure to use it.
```typescript
  fetch: `loadingCursorFetch ( fetchWithDelay ( 1, fetchWithPrefix ( 'http://localhost:${javaPort}', loggingFetchFn ) ) )`,
```

# RefDs
We have the situation where we need to 'load' data before the pages are displayed. This is for things like holidays, 'today' and in the future might be 'currency conversions'. 
For these we have created `RefD`s which are like pages but simpler. These Refs will be loaded at the start of the 'session'. In addition we can group the Refds. For now just give any group name. 
Using `once` is a good choice: it means you expect this to be loaded once in the session

```typescript
 const commonDataRefD: RefD<G> = {
    name: "CommonData",
    refGroups: 'once',
    commonParams: { jurisdiction: { ...StringParam, commonLens: 'jurisdiction', testValue: 'GB' } }, // This says 'we need a CommonId called jurisdiction
    domain: {
      dates: { dataDD: timeDataD } // We great domains like normal. This is available to the rest of the world by /CommonData/dates
    },
    rest: {
      dates: { rest: dateinfoRestD, targetFromPath: '~/dates', fetcher: true }
    },
  }
```

# Dates
The date picker can now be used

It defaults to `dd-MM-yyyy`, and in order to use holidays and today correctly it requires you to have a refD. My generated looks like this
```typescript
export type ExampleRefD = RefD<AllGuards>
export const generatedRefs: ExampleRefD[] = [ dateInfoRefD () ] //<--- This is how we pull in the dateInfo. You will 
generate ( logLevel, directorySpec, devAppConfig, {
    ...params,
    endpointImports: [],
    focusOnVersion,
    debugLevel: 'debug'
  },
  javaOutputRoot, tsRoot, AllGuardCreator, makeButtons () )
( generatedPages, generatedRefs ) //<----------------- Note generated refs
```

Here are some examples of the `DateWithDatePickerDD` in use

```typescript
structure: {
    empty: { dataDD: DateWithDatePickerDD, displayParams: { label: 'Nothing specified' } },
    emptyAndReadonly: { dataDD: DateWithDatePickerDD, displayParams: { label: 'Nothing specified - readonly', readonly: true } },
    emptyAndNotRequired: { dataDD: DateWithDatePickerDD, displayParams: { label: 'Nothing specified - required false', required: false } },
    value: { dataDD: { ...DateWithDatePickerDD, emptyValue: '6/7/2022' }, displayParams: { label: 'Specified 6/7/2022' } },
    valueDateFormat: { dataDD: { ...DateWithDatePickerDD, emptyValue: '2022/7/5' }, displayParams: { label: 'Specified 2022/7/5 (different date format) ', dateFormat: 'yyyy/MM/dd' } },
    future: { dataDD: DateWithDatePickerDD, displayParams: { label: 'Future', dateRange: { type: 'future' } } },
    past: { dataDD: DateWithDatePickerDD, displayParams: { label: 'Past', dateRange: { type: 'past' } } },
    monthYear: { dataDD: { ...MonthYearWithDatePickerDD, emptyValue: '8/2022' } },
    fiveWorkingDaysHolidaysNotSpecified: {
      dataDD: DateWithDatePickerDD, displayParams: {
        dateRange: { type: 'future', allowWeekends: false, allowHolidays: false, minWorkingDaysBefore: 5 }
      }
    },
    fiveWorkingDaysWeekendsAllowed: {
      dataDD: { ...DateWithDatePickerDD, emptyValue: undefined, allowUndefined: true }, displayParams: {
        dateRange: { type: 'future', allowWeekends: true, allowHolidays: false, minWorkingDaysBefore: 5 }
      }
    },
    fiveWorkingDaysHolidaysAllowed: {
      dataDD: { ...DateWithDatePickerDD, emptyValue: undefined, allowUndefined: true }, displayParams: {
        dateRange: { type: 'future', allowWeekends: false, allowHolidays: true, minWorkingDaysBefore: 5 }
      }
    }
  }
```
If you need more control you can make your own types. The standard datepicker covers most needs though I think
```typescript
export const DateWithDatePickerDD: DatePrimitiveDD = {
  format: { type: 'Date', pattern: "dd-MM-yyyy" },
  ...datePrimDD,
  name: 'Date',
  emptyValue: undefined,
  allowUndefined: true,
  description: "The primitive representing a date (w/o time)",
  display: DatePicker2CD,
  displayParams: { dateFormat: "dd-MM-yyyy", dateInfo: '/CommonData/dates', jurisdiction: '/CommonIds/jurisdiction' },
  sample: [ "1-10-2022", '01-11-2022', '01-12-2022' ],
}

export const DatePicker2CD: DisplayCompD = {
  import: "@focuson-nw/form_components", name: "DatePicker",
  params: {
    ...commonParamsWithLabel,
    required: { paramType: 'boolean', needed: 'no' },
    dateFormat: { paramType: 'string', needed: 'no' },
    dateRange: { paramType: 'json', needed: 'no' },
    jurisdiction: { paramType: 'path', needed: 'no' },
    dateInfo: { paramType: 'path', needed: 'no' },
    showMonthYearPicker: { paramType: 'boolean', needed: 'no' },
    placeholder: { paramType: 'string', needed: 'no' }
  }
}
export type DateRange<S, C> = DateRangeInPast<S, C> | DateRangeInFuture<S, C> | AnyDateRange<S, C>
interface CommonDateRange<S, C> {
  allowWeekends?: boolean;
  allowHolidays?: boolean;
  defaultDay?: boolean
}
export interface DateRangeInPast<S, C> extends CommonDateRange<S, C> {
  type: 'past'
}
export interface DateRangeInFuture<S, C> extends CommonDateRange<S, C> {
  type: 'future'
  minWorkingDaysBefore?: number;
}
export interface AnyDateRange<S, C> extends CommonDateRange<S, C> {
}
```

# LayoutCD can now takes scrollAfter
```typescript
export const RequestDetailsDD: ExampleDataD = {
  name: 'RequesterDetails',
  description: 'The information about the person who requested the paymets',
  layout: { component: LayoutCd, displayParams: { details: '[[1,1,1], [1], [1], [1], [1,1], [1,1]]', scrollAfter: '200px' } },
```



#Bugs
 tag fetcher debug and ids

#removed
SearchListItemsCD

# Common ids error message
We have improved this


# Migration guide
You WILL need to delete the src folders for `formTs` and `formJava`
You may have a problem with `react-dom` if you do let me know. We've tried to fix this, but npm is giving us 'issues'. Sometimes deleting `node_modules` fixes these issues 
* If the loss of `SearchListItemsCD` gives you problems let me know. I don't think it was used
* If you want the new date picker you need to have the refs. Please note that if you had your own holiday service you can probably delete it now
* If you want the `loadingCursorFetch` you have to add it. Find the place that currently looks like this and change it
```typescript
  fetch: `loadingCursorFetch ( fetchWithDelay ( 1, fetchWithPrefix ( 'http://localhost:${javaPort}', loggingFetchFn ) ) )`,
```

# Known issues
* datepicker has a css issue with the < and >. 
* The custom layout doesn't work for repeating data groups

# Work in progress
* Moving modal page namespace to page name space: this allows multiple pages to have the same name
* Validation and 'why can't I click this button'
