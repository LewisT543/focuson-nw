# alias on main entity (sql)
  Oracle 10g only has 32 characters for table and field names. If we need to 'shrink' a main name we can give it an alias
  This feature isn't fully working yet: it will be fixed on the nightly
```typescript
 tables: {
    where: [...],
    entity: {
      type: 'Main',
      table: accountT,
      alias: 'j',
```

# Messaging
##  messageType on output params
This notation tells the framework that if the variable is a non empty string that it is 
to be treated as a message. For example if a stored procedure has an output `errorMsg` then
if that is non null we will display the error message on the gui

There are three msgLevels: error, info and warning
```typescript
  { type: 'output', javaType: 'String', name: 'errorMsg', msgLevel: 'error' },
```

##  Data format changed to support messages
The data from the APIs has all changed. You can see this in the browser console (network tab). The main
data is now under `data` and messages are under `messages`

## Pages have time stamps now
This will probably have no impact on you yet. It's done so that we can improve how messages are
displayed to the user. 


# Redux
* We can now use redux as the engine
This should have no impact on you. It does remove a number of (rarely occuring) race conditions
and eases integration with the main gui

# Main tables as modal pages
This still needs more testing: it's beleived complete and all the current tests past, but there is every chance we 'missed something'. It's a beta release feature

## modals in pageD
We need to add the main page to the list of modals.  Note that it is a 'main' and not a modal
```typescript

export const LinkedAccountDetailsPD: ExampleMainPage = {
  name: "LinkedAccountDetails",
  display: { target: '~/display', dataDD: linkedAccountDetailsDD },
  modals: [ { modal: SelectMandateMP }, { modal: CreatePaymentMP }, { main: OverpaymentMainPage } ],
  //....
}
```
## modal button
We use a 'main'  instead of a modal and there is no focuson property. This should be typechecked but there is a typescript bug
Note that now when we do copies the meaning of '~' changes depending on whether we are copying from or to...

```typescript
 buttons: {
    overpaymentHistory: {
      control: 'ModalButton',
      mode: 'view',
      main: OverpaymentMainPage,    
      copy: { from: '~/rememberedForTest', to: '~/selectedIndex' },
      copyOnClose: { from: '~/selectedIndex', to: '~/rememberedForTest' }
    }
  },
```

# Tables
## emptyData & tableTitle
```typescript
export const postCodeSearchResponseDD: RepeatingDataD<AllGuards> = {
  name: "PostCodeSearchResponseForListOfPayments",
  description: "The array of all the data",
  dataDD: postCodeDataForListOfPaymentsLineD,
  paged: false,
  display: TableCD,
  displayParams: {
    emptyData: 'No results',
    tableTitle: 'Search results',
    order: [ 'postcode', 'line1', 'line2', 'line3', 'line4' ],
    //...
  }
}
```
## Structure Tables

There will be occasions where the data being shown isn't just a simple child of a data structure. The idea in @focuson
is that the simple is easy and the complex is doable. The simple (most of the data being a single structure) is easy.
But when we move to more complicated structures it is a little more complex.

Instead of `order` we have `paths`. The other difference is that there are no `joiners`.

```typescript
export const postCodeSearchResponseDD: RepeatingDataD<AllGuards> = {
  name: "PostCodeSearchResponse",
  description: "The array of all the data",
  dataDD: postCodeDataLineD,
  paged: false,
  display: StructureTableCD,
  displayParams: {
    paths: { postcode: 'postcode', line1: 'line1', line2: 'line2', line3: 'line3', line4: 'line4' },  //<--------------
    copySelectedItemTo: [ 'postcode', 'addressResults' ],
    copySelectedIndexTo: [ 'selectedPostcodeIndex' ],
  }}
```
# Rests
Rests can have multiple deletes

# Multiple paths on action buttons
```typescript
 buttons: {
  approvePendingFees: { control: "ActionButton", 
          path: '#editingData', 
          paths: { 
                    pathRepeated: '#editingData',
                    otherData: '~/selectedDateItem/dateCreated' 
               },
          text: 'Approve Pending Fees', 
            action: 'approvePendingFees' },
  authoriseApprovedFees: { control: "ActionButton", path: '#editingData', text: 'Authorise Approved Fees', action: 'authoriseApprovedFees' },

}
```

# Bug fixes
Empty values and booleans...

# Mutations / Resolvers
## autowiring for class variables
```typescript
   mutations: [{
            restAction: 'create',
            autowired: { class: '{thePackage}.utils.IOGNL', variableName: 'ognl', imports: true },
            //...
```
## makeMock
We sometimes don't want a mock being created for our mutations and resolvers. We can turn them off with our makeMock.
```typescript
mutations: [
    {
      restAction: 'get', mutateBy:
        {
          type: 'manual', name: 'testForMessages',
          makeMock: false,                            //<-----------
          code: [ `
          String errorMsg = "the error message";
          String warningMsg = "the warning message";
          String infoMsg = "the info message";
          ` ], params: [
            { type: 'output', javaType: 'String', name: 'errorMsg', msgLevel: 'error' },
            { type: 'output', javaType: 'String', name: 'warningMsg', msgLevel: 'warning' },
            { type: 'output', javaType: 'String', name: 'infoMsg', msgLevel: 'info' },
          ]
        }
    }
  ]
```
## Optional names for manual and sql mutations and resolvers
Previously we had to give a name for manual and sql mutations and resolvers. We don't now
