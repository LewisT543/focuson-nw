# guardFns

```typescript
    guards: {
      balanceZero: { condition: 'fn', name: 'balanceZero', path: "~/some/data" }
    },
```
This is in a file somewhere. Let's call it 'guardFns.ts'
```typescript
import { LensState } from "@focuson/state";

export interface HasValue{
  value: number
}
export function balanceZero<S,V extends HasValue, C>(s: LensState<S,V[], C>): boolean{
  const data = s.optJsonOr([])
  const balance = data.reduce((acc, v)=> acc + v.value, 0)
  return balance === 0
}
```
We need to copy it. Modify your generation code
```typescript
fse.copySync ( './src/guardFns.ts', tsRoot + "/src/guardFns.ts" )
```
And then tell the system it exists

```typescript

generate ( logLevel, directorySpec, devAppConfig, {
    ...params,
    guardFnsFile: '../guardFns',  // <----------------- otherwise the imports won't work
    controllerAnnotations: [ "@CrossOrigin()" ],
```

# Modified where the request.controllers go

# LabelAndFixedNumber
has an optional className now. Mostly this is used in custom components 

# Support for functions that return pageDs
We have the case where we need X pages that are almost the same. The only difference is the backend, and perhaps some labels on the screen. For example
the authoriseCharges page has two backends that differ only very slightly

## Steps to do this
* Create an customisation interface that captures the differences
* Change the dataD to functions that are given the customisation interface and return a DataD. Please note that these should be memoised. 
* Change the restD to functions that are given the customisation interface return a RestD. These don't need to be momoised (but it's not an error if you do)
* Change the pageD to functions that are given the customisation interface returning a PageD. These don't need to be momoised (but it's not an error if you do)
* 'use' the customisation interface. 
  * The urls must be different
  * The pagename of the main page needs to be different
  * We need to give the restDs a namePrefix
  * We probably need different tables
  * We may want different labels
* Call the pageD function in the list of generated pages

# Resolvers
Combination of a bug and a new feature
Bug: We added the output parameters of list mutations (sql/storedproc etc) when the result is an object, and those variables don't exist
Feature: We want to be able to return the result of a manual code block as the result of a feature. So we just create an output variable with the resolvername


# Migration guide
You will need to delete your generated source code. Especially the java: the file layout of request controllers and the wiring has changed a lot
* The request controllers are in different packages
* There is now a 'wiring' package
* Each page has its own graphql

If you have 'sidecared' your mvn.pom, or the rest controllers, or the graphql schema  you will get issues.

make a special note about the graplql in the mvn.pom
