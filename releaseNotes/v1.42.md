# Jwt tokens
Things marked as JWT are now `@RequestHeader`s.

#  postProcessMessages: ['infoToSuccess']
If you want to, you can ask a restD to change all the 'info' messages it returns from the back end to a success. This is
added because in the environment we are running in the api is not allowed 'success' messages but the gui wants to show them.
It is a little bit of a bodge, but was felt the best option. 

It is done this way because we can add other postProcessMessages in the future

# Added 'regexForChange' to LabelAndInput 
You can add a 'guardsForChange' if you only want the `onChanges` to 'fire' if a guard condition is true. 
This feature is not recommend. It is complex, difficult to debug and should only be used when we have no alternative
In the following code the message '0-9' is sent if the `date` matches the regex. 

An example of using this would be to copy the variable if it changes as long as the data matches some regex. i.e. matches something that looks a little like a
date (you can't do a date properly with a regex)
 ```typescript
  structure: {
      date: {
        dataDD: StringDD,
          displayParams: { buttons: [ 'selectDate' ], onChange: [ { command: 'message', msg: '0-9' } ], regexForChange: '<put the reg ex here>' }
      }}
```

# Equals and not equals guards now have ifUndefined

So if the value pointed at in the path doesn't exist you can control what it returns. This is designed to help with messages where there are two 
guards one 'is something selected' and the other 'is the thing selected OK'. In this case using `Ã¬fUndefined: true` means that only message is displayed to the user.
```typescript
  yes: { condition: 'equals', path: 'dropdown', value: '"Y"', ifUndefined: true, message: 'Select Yes to enable' },
```

# Date picker
Now shows red, effects the confirm/rest buttons and when a date is manually typed in that is checked properly as well.

# Added throwsException to manual mutations

# If we have an 'error message' then we auto return a 400 bad request and don't continue

# Actions Buttons & List Prev/Next have button type

# Can have commands on confirm window buttons

```typescript
  buttons: {
    cancel: { control: 'ModalCancelButton' , confirm: { type: 'window', title: 'The title for the cancel'  , showCancelButton: false }},
    commit: { control: 'ModalCommitButton', confirm: { type: 'window', confirmCommands: {command: 'message', msg: 'canceling'}, cancelCommands: {command: 'message', msg: 'not canceling'}  , showCancelButton: true } }

```

# Time stamp command
```typescript
    rest: {
      dates: { rest: dateinfoRestD, targetFromPath: '~/dates', fetcher: true, postFetchCommands: { command: 'timestamp', path: '/CommonData/now' } }
    },
```

# dateRef now has `now` and `serverNow`
Example.

Note that these still need to be plumbed into the back end
```json
  {"CommonData": {
    "now": "2022-09-30T05:28:21.295Z",
    "dates": {
      "today": "01-07-2022",
      "holidays": [
        {"date": "02-07-2022", "jurisdiction": "GB"},
        {"date": "04-07-2022", "jurisdiction": "I"},
        {"date": "06-07-2022", "jurisdiction": "GB"}
      ],
      "dateFormat": "dd-MM-yyyy"
    }
  }}
```



#   'dateChecks' for guard
Only work with dd/MM/yyyy or dd-MM-yyyy
```typescript
  {guards: {
    before: { condition: 'before', aPath: '~/dates/empty', bPath: '~/dates/value'},
    beforeOrEquals: { condition: 'beforeOrEquals', aPath: '~/dates/empty', bPath: '~/dates/value' },
    afterOrEquals: { condition: 'afterOrEquals', aPath: '~/dates/empty', bPath: '~/dates/value' },
    after: { condition: 'after', aPath: '~/dates/empty', bPath: '~/dates/value'},
  }}
```
