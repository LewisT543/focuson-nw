# Features


## Minor Features
* multiline sql
In the resolvers and mutations previously the sql had to be a single line and couldn't have new lines in it. This is fixed

* MoneyDD is now a float.
Money needs to include the representation of two decimal places. This will cause compilation issues, so you need to follow the migration guide

* DBTables don't need audit now
Previously any table would

* Build x of y
  *   
* displayParams: { index: '~/selected', display: printRecordDD.name, header: 'Request # ', showNofM: true },
* alias on main entity (sql) 

# Minor stuff
Table can now display null data
Patterns
