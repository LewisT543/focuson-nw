# Features

## Minor Features
* multiline sql
In the resolvers and mutations previously the sql had to be a single line and couldn't have new lines in it. This is fixed
```typescript
export const newPaymentsRD: ExampleRestD = {
  params: commonIds,
   ...
  resolvers: {
    getoneLinePayment: {
      type: 'case', name: 'case', params: [ 'brandRef', 'accountId',  ...], select: [
        {
          guard: [ 'brandRef==3' ], type: 'sql', name: '', schema: onlySchema,
          sql: `select nameOfPayee,sterlingAmount,currencyAmount,
                 amtInWords,forActionOn,dateCreated,status 
                 from tableForBrand3 where acc = accountId`, 
         ...
```

* MoneyDD is now a float.
Money needs to include the representation of two decimal places. 

* DBTables don't need audit now
```typescript
export const postCodeSearchTable: DBTable = {
  schema: onlySchema,
  prefix: 'search',
  name: 'POSTCODE',
  description: '',
  notes: '',
  audit: ... // This has been removed. It still compiles but doesn't do anything
}
```

* Variables in paths
The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle was becoming violated in the lens paths. The same path would be repeated again and again.
A variable mechanism has been implemented. There are two types of these path variables.  `code` and `path`

`code` is used when the path is too complex for the path language to use properly. A good example of this is the main/joint accounts where
there is an if statement in the path.
`path` can be used just avoid repeating ourselves

If you find you have a path that is too complex for the path language. Shout out! This is just an example of how code can be injected. It requires 
an understanding of the lens to understand
```typescript
//Part of a pageD
{domain: {
  fromApi: { dataDD: JointAccountDd },
  joint: { dataDD: BooleanDD },
  temp: { dataDD: JointAccountCustomerDD }
},
variables: {
  selectedAccount: {
    constructedBy: 'code',
            code: ` id => {
    return Lenses.chainNthFromOptionalFn ( id, state => {
      if ( state.JointAccount?.joint )
        return id.focusQuery ( 'JointAccount' ).focusQuery ( 'fromApi' ).focusQuery ( 'joint' )
      else
        return id.focusQuery ( 'JointAccount' ).focusQuery ( 'fromApi' ).focusQuery ( 'main' )
    }, '#currentOccupation' )
  }`
  }
},
modals: [ { modal: JointAccountEditModalPageD } ],
```
 
The paths though are much simpler
```typescript
  variables:{
    fromApi:{constructedBy: 'path', path: '~/authorisedCharges/fromApi'},
    searchResults:{constructedBy: 'path', path: '~/summaryOfChargesDates/searchResults'},
    authorisedDate:{constructedBy: 'path', path: '~/authorisedCharges/date'},
    authorisedCharges:{constructedBy: 'path', path: '~/authorisedCharges'},
    editingData:{constructedBy: 'path', path: '~/authorisedCharges/fromApi/editingData'},
  },
```
These variables can be accessed in normal path strings like this:
```typescript
 buttons: {
    select: { control: 'ModalButton', modal: ViewChargesPage, mode: 'edit', focusOn: '#authorisedCharges', enabledBy: 'brandSelected' }
  }
```

Please experiment with this feature and see if there is anywhere that doesn't work with it!

* Selected item enhancements
This allows us to show 'n of m' when we are selecting an item from a list
```typescript
displayParams: { index: '~/selected', display: printRecordDD.name, header: 'Request # ', showNofM: true },
```

# Minor stuff
* Table can now display null data
Previously this caused the display to blow up

* Inputs can have patterns
these are the standard html regexes
 
* Validation logic now doesn't cause red
Previously the validation logic caused error messages to appear in the console. This has been fixed

* enabledBy on modalbuttons is string or string[]
Previously it was just a string

# Warnings
The fetcher / rest code has been heavily changed. I expect no issues with this, but if you get one please let me know!

# Migration guide

Most importantly you will need to delete the generated source code: there are a number of changes that mean if you don't, there will be issues
* Delete <yourformjava>/src and sub directories
* Delete <yourformts>/src and sub directories

* The only known issue is MoneyDD
This used to be an integer and is now a float. You need to change any params that are a MoneyDD. For example:
```typescript
  params: { ...collectionPaymentParams, amount: { ...FloatParam, lens: '~/createPayment/amount', testValue: '' } }
```
