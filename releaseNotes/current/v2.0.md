Welcome to v2.0 - currently this weeks version is the same as 1.44.1 version. This will obviously change as we start to tinker and make changes to the framework.

2.0.2

Changed default for 'HaveTopRightCrossToCancel' from _**true**_ to **_false_**

If we want a page to have an exit cross, we must now explicitly add it in the modal page definition
```typescript
const wizard1: ExampleModalPage = {
  pageType: 'ModalPopup',
  modes: [ 'view' ],
  name: "Wizard1",
  
  haveTopRightCrossToCancel: true

```

New Command: CloseAllModalPages - can be added anywhere (rest, button, onChange, etc)

Closes all currently open pages that are not the mainpage (position 0 in PageSelection[])
this is referring to the list of pages found in the fullState for our pages.
```typescript
command: { command: 'closeAllModalPages' }
```
