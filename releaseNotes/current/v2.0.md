Welcome to v2.0 - currently this weeks version is the same as 1.44.1 version. This will obviously change as we start to tinker and make changes to the framework.

2.0.2

<H2>Changed default for 'HaveTopRightCrossToCancel' from _**true**_ to **_false_**<h2/>

If we want a page to have an exit cross, we must now explicitly add it in the modal page definition
```typescript
const wizard1: ExampleModalPage = {
  pageType: 'ModalPopup',
  modes: [ 'view' ],
  name: "Wizard1",
  
  haveTopRightCrossToCancel: true

```

<H2>New Command: CloseAllModalPages - can be added anywhere (rest, button, onChange, etc)<H2/>

Closes all currently open pages that are not the mainpage (position 0 in PageSelection[])
this is referring to the list of pages found in the fullState for our pages.
```typescript
{ control: 'CommandButton', command: { command: 'closeAllModalPages' } }
```

<h2>Added 'isOnModalPage' to datepickers<h2/>

This is a boolean variable which will make a datepicker popup always appear below the field. This is useful when
our datepicker overlaps the HOS UI.

```typescript
structure: {
    datepickerOnModalPage: { 
      dataDD: DateWithDatePickerDD, 
      displayParams: { 
        label: 'Future', 
        dateRange: { type: 'future' }, 
        dateInfo: '/FocusonCommonData/dates', 
        isOnModalPage: true
      }
    },
  }
```
