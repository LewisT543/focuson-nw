# Version 1.14

This is mainly 'features added to support forms'

## Integration work

### GraphQL no longer 'mandates' that a field is present

Previously GraphQl forced every field that was requested to exist in the result (i.e. have a non-null value). This was
very helpful during development and found many issues. However in practice some of the data is a null. Rather than do
'fine grained control' where we can say/not say, we just turned the feature off. HAving to say 'added work' and it's not
clear what the benefit would be

## SQL data structures have on/off

This stops the `data.sql' and `schema.sql` being generated. Those files are only needed for development

```typescript
export const devAppConfig: AppConfig = {
  javaPort,
  tsPort,
  versionNumber: '0.0.1',
  fetch: `fetchWithDelay ( 1, fetchWithPrefix ( 'http://localhost:${javaPort}', loggingFetchFn ) )`,
  combine: MyCombineCD,
  debug: {
    fetcherDebug: false,
    guardDebug: false,
    restDebug: false,
    selectedPageDebug: false,
    loadTreeDebug: false,
    showTracing: false,
    recordTrace: true,
    tagFetcherDebug: false,
    accordions: []
  },
  makeSqlStrings: false
}
```

Known issue: An extra file `insertData.sql` is created. The content in there should have been added to `data.sql`

## Action Buttons

We have a need to do `arbitary code` in one of the new forms. Interestingly this is the first time this has come up, so
we should probably try and use these at little as possible

### Steps

Buttons of type `ActionButton` are added like most buttons
```json
   {
  approvePendingFees:    {control: "ActionButton", text: 'Approve Pending Fees', action: 'approvePendingFees'},
  authoriseApprovedFees: {control: "ActionButton", text: 'Authorise Approved Fees', action: 'authoriseApprovedFees'}
}
```
Then the file src/actions.ts is created. Note that this is shared by all pages at the moment
```typescript
import { LensState } from "@focuson-nw/state";

export function approvePendingFees<S, C> ( s: LensState<S, any, C>, id: string ) {
  console.log ( "in approve pending fees" )
}
export function authoriseApprovedFees<S, C> ( s: LensState<S, any, C>, id: string ) {
  console.log ( "in authorise" )
}
```
Warning: This feature is undesirable. Please use it as little as possible. In the future the code will probably move to an `actions.ts` per page

## Message on commit
When a restful action has taken place the normal message (which is aimed at developers) can be replaced. This can be specified in RestButtons or in ModalButtons
```typescript
 buttons: {
  orderNewBook: {
    control: 'ModalButton', modal: OrderChequeBookOrPayingInModalPD, mode: 'create',
      pageParams: { position: { top: 123 } },
    focusOn: '~/tempCreatePlan',//not type checked here... should be type checked in target
      createEmpty: ChequeCreditbooksHistoryLineDD,
      restOnCommit: { restName: 'chequeCreditBooks', action: 'create', result: 'refresh', messageOnSuccess: 'Ordered cheque book' }
  },
  cancelCheckBook: {
    control: 'RestButton', restName: 'chequeCreditBooks', enabledBy: 'canCancel', confirm: 'Really?', action: { state: 'cancel' },
    messageOnSuccess: 'Cancelled cheque book'
  }
}
```

##  Can now have 'case' statements in resolvers and mutations. So the mutation/resolver is dependent on some condition (like brandId)
This works with both resolvers and mutations

Note that at the moment it is quite verbose. It is intended to make some helper methods to reduce the verbosity. 


### Steps:
* There is new `type` called `case`. This takes
  * params: This specifies the input and output parameters that can be used internally. If something isn't here it can't be used internally and outputParams will not be returned
    * Note: If you give an output param here, every single guard condition should use it 
  * name: just a human readable identifier that will be used to create a java method (so no spaces please)
  * select: a list of 'guarded mutations'. Only the first for which the guard condition is true will be executed: the others ignored
* Set up your guards
  * Guards are just boolean conditions that act on the parameters. The example below shows the first condition is about `brandRef` and the second is basically `if true` so a catch all 
```typescript
    mutateBy: {
      type: 'case', name: 'create', params: [
        'brandRef', "accountId",
        { type: 'output', name: 'one', javaType: 'String' },
        { type: 'output', name: 'two', javaType: 'Integer' },
      ], select: [
        {
          guard: [ 'brandRef==3' ], type: 'storedProc', name: 'one', params: [
            { type: 'string', value: 'first' },
            "accountId",
            { type: 'output', name: 'one', javaType: 'String', sqlType: 'CHAR' },
            { type: 'output', name: 'two', javaType: 'Integer', sqlType: 'INTEGER' },
          ], schema: onlySchema, package: 'bo11'
        },
        {
          guard: [], type: 'storedProc', name: 'two', params: [
            { type: 'string', value: 'second' },
            { type: 'output', name: 'two', javaType: 'Integer', sqlType: 'INTEGER' },
            { type: 'output', name: 'one', javaType: 'String', sqlType: 'CHAR' },
            "accountId",
          ], schema: onlySchema, package: 'bo11'
        },
      ]
    }
```
##  Can now nearly have headers as arguments
Kind of...

There are some complexities around generating the mocks for this. Mostly because I can't do it manually yet. This is a fine
example of where SpringBoot's underlying technology (Servlets) were designed to be untestable (they are mutable objects that
cannot be copied or extended and don't implement equals)

It is intended to use the same code in production and development. For now I'm stuck so we can do this:
```typescript
export const allCommonIds = {
  brandRef: { ...IntParam, commonLens: 'brandRef', testValue: 10 },
  applRef: { ...IntParam, commonLens: 'applRef', testValue: 888 },
  clientRef: { ...IntParam, commonLens: 'clientRef', testValue: 666, annotation: '@RequestHeader @RequestParam' },
  accountId: { ...IntParam, commonLens: 'accountId', testValue: 12342312 },
  employeeType: { ...StringParam, commonLens: 'employeeType', testValue: 'basic', annotation: '@RequestHeader @RequestParam' },
  dbName: { ...StringParam, commonLens: 'dbName', testValue: 'mock' }
}
```
The notation `@RequestHeader @RequestParam` means 'Either a RequestHeader or a RequestParam'. This implements the serverside
code correctly. I am still working on the client side.

# Bug fixes
* Fixed issue with java type in db fetchers (always a string even if the parameter was an int)

# Migration Notes
* None known

## Known issues / backlog
* Auto generated Pact tests don't work with custom lens that have nested paths such as 
```typescript
  params: {
    ...PrintRecordHistoryParams,
    id: { ...IntParam, lens: '~/display[~/selected]id', testValue: 888, main: true }
  },
```
* InsertSql
  * This should arrive in `data.sql`
* Messages vanish
  * When we delete after a rest this accidentally deletes messages. As does changing pages.
* The parameters sent to state changes have to be a subset of the known parameters. This should be a 'free list' and each state change be different
* Dates. There are little issues with the date picker around date formats and what happens when the date is null
* We are merging the theming work
