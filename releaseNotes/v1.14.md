* GraphQL no longer 'mandates' that a field is present
* SQL data structures have on/off
* Message on commit
* Can now have 'case' statements in resolvers and mutations. So the mutation/resolver is dependent on some condition (like brandId) 
* Can now have headers as arguments
Bug fixes
* Fixed issue with java type in db fetchers (always a string even if the parameter was an int)
