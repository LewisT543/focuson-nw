# Integration 

A lot of our work has been on 'getting things working in the integration environment'. We are now deployed there: front end
and backend. Small changes were needed, but they should have no impact on any of our developers


## TableWithVaryingOrderCD
```typescript
export const SummaryOfPaymentsTableDD: ExampleRepeatingD = {
  name: "SummaryOfPaymentsTable",
  description: "",
  dataDD: SummaryOfPaymentsLineDD,
  display: TableWithVaryingOrderCD,
  sampleCount: 10,
  displayParams: {
    order: {
      e: [ 'nameOfPayee', 'currency', 'sterlingAmount', 'currencyAmount', 'dateCreated', 'forActionOn', 'status' ],
      c: [ 'nameOfPayee', 'sterlingAmount', 'dateCreated', 'forActionOn', 'status' ],
    },
    select: '~/summary/payment/paymentType',
    rights: [ 'sterlingAmount', 'currencyAmount', 'dateCreated', 'forActionOn', 'status' ],
    scrollAfter: '100px',
    copySelectedIndexTo: [ 'selectedPaymentIndex' ],
    copySelectedItemTo: [ 'selectedPayment' ]
  },
  paged: false
}

```

## endpointImports
When we add controllerAnnotations and endpointAnnotations we need to be able to import the annotations.

```typescript
generate ( logLevel, directorySpec, devAppConfig, {
    ...params,
    controllerAnnotations: [ "@CrossOrigin()" ],
    endpointAnnotations: [],
    endpointImports: [],  //<-- here we can add any imports we want to support the controllerAnnotations and endpointAnnotations 
    focusOnVersion,
    thePackage: 'somepackage.somepostfix.another',
    theme: 'theme-dark'
    ,
  },
  javaOutputRoot, tsRoot, AllGuardCreator, makeButtons () ) ( generatedPages )
```

# Backend formatting
Previous we had dateFormat. We discovered we needed to format doubles and ints as well...
We made a breaking change. This requires some changes if you have used DateFormat.

This is for things like 'the data in the database is a double, and we need to transmit it across the wire as a string in a particular format'.

A classical use for this is when we need to display money with two digits. We have to turn the number that represents 
the number into a string with a specific format.

```typescript
 mutations: [
    {
      restAction: 'get', mutateBy: [ {
        type: 'sql', makeMock: false, sql: `select amount as amountd, id , amount as amounts
                                            from ${collectionHistoryTableDD.name}`, params: [
          { type: 'output', name: 'amtDouble', format: { type: 'Double', pattern: '%,2f' }, rsName: 'amountd', javaType: 'String' },
          { type: 'output', name: 'id', format: { type: 'Integer', pattern: '%d' }, rsName: 'id', javaType: 'String' },
          { type: 'output', name: 'amtString', format: { type: 'String', pattern: '%s' }, rsName: 'amounts', javaType: 'String' }
        ], schema: onlySchema
      } ]
    },
```

# MoneyAsString

This is how we can have money that is a string with two decimal places

```typescript
export const MoneyStringDD: StringPrimitiveDD = {
  ...stringPrimDD,
  display: LabelAndStringInputCD,
  format: { type: 'Double', pattern: '%,2f' },
  displayParams: { readonly: true },
  sample: [ '100.23', '200.45', '300.00' ],
  name: 'DisplayMoney',
  description: "The primitive representing an amount of the local currency that is represented as a string",
  validate: { pattern: '^[-+]?[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]?[0-9]?$' }
}
```

# Improvement with state mutations 

Previously you had to always specify the url and param for a state

```typescript

export const chequeCreditBooksRestD: RestD<AllGuards> = {
  params: commonIds,
  dataDD: ChequeCreditbooksDD,
  url: '/api/chequeCreditBooks?{query}', //or maybe accountId={accountId}&customerId={customerId}
  actions: [ 'get', 'create', { "state": 'cancel' }, { "state": 'revalidate' } ],
  states: {
    cancel: { url: '/api/chequeCreditBooks/cancel?{query}', params: fromCommonIds ( 'clientRef', 'accountId', 'brandRef' ) },
    revalidate: { url: '/api/chequeCreditBooks/revalidate?{query}', params: fromCommonIds ( 'clientRef', 'accountId' ) }
  },
```
However now, if the params are the same as the normal params, and the url is the same as the url, you don't have to specify this. The `states`
block is now optional. This is just a  `quality of life` improvement and is helpful when we have rest resources that only do one state change

# Bugs 

* There might be an issue with maxlength in text area
* Bug with date pattern and stored procedures


# Work in progress

## New DatePicker
Now works for 'non holidays'. We're working on how to make it work simply with holidays (very messy at the moment)

## Validation
We started it last week, but this week were working on integration

# Work we will be doing this week
API integration. The postcode service will need an API call. We will do it manually first and then tidy it up.

# Migration guide
Unusually this week we have a breaking change. 
## Date format
Previously we could use `datePattern`

If you have any examples using it, change them to the new format pattern.

Change this
```typescript
    { type: 'output', name: 'someDate', datePattern: 'dd/MM/yyyy',  rsName: 'someDate', javaType: 'String' },
```
to this
```typescript
    { type: 'output', name: 'someDate', format: { type: 'Date', pattern: 'dd/MM/yyyy' }, rsName: 'someDate', javaType: 'String' },
```

## There might be an issue with maxlength in text area

An example of usage is as follows. Note that there are no uppercase characters in maxlength
```typescript
textArea: { dataDD: ManyLineStringDD, displayParams: { enabledBy: [ 'yes' ], maxlength: 200 } },
```
