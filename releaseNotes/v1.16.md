# Featurs
* Tablenames can have prefix
* Action buttons can have path
* Params now have 'setParam' which allows 'fine' control of what we insert into the stored procedure 'setParam'. Good for dates and last minute transformations
* input and autowired mutation/resolved params have a 'required' field (default true).

# Bugs
* loading lists of data
