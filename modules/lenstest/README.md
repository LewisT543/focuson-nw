* [@phil-rice/lens: Easy - perhaps even beautiful - code for editing deep immutable objects](modules/lens/README.md)
* [@phil-rice/state: State management for projects (including React) using the lens in the above project](modules/state/README.md)
 
They have been moved here to keep the main projects small
